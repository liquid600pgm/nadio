# Nadio

An experimental digital audio workstation with a modular audio engine based on
nodes, fully controllable using a keyboard using Vim-like keybindings. Inspired
by [Blender][blender], [Reason][reason], [FL Studio][fl studio], and
[VCV Rack][vcv rack].

The `N` in 'Nadio' stands for _node_, _novel_, and _Nim_.

This app is still highly WIP. Here's a roadmap of planned features:

- [ ] Song view
- [ ] Pattern view
- [ ] Instrument view
  - [x] Node editor
  - [ ] Plugin system
  - [ ] Node library
  - [ ] Keyboard controls

The roadmap will be expanded once I plan specific features out. Version 0.1.0
will be released once all features listed here will be implemented (no deadline,
I work on Nadio as a hobby and prefer to release something complete and stable
rather than something barely usable).

Nadio will always be free software, to make music creation accessible to
everyone. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.
